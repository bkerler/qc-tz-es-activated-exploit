This is a rewrite of laginimaineb TrustZone zero-write exploit as a kernel module instead of using a user space program and using a custom kernel, which is the case for his FuzzZone application. See:

The original exploit was built around the Nexus 5 hammerhead. My test device was both a Nexus 5 and a LG G2

####Build: 

 1. Update environment paths in ./Makefile
 2. Update environment paths in ./shellcode/Makefile
 3. Run make

####Install: 

 1. Transfer compiled module and shellcode to device 
 2. Run insmod tz_exploit.ko  [SHELLCODE_PATH] [SHELLCODE_IS_THUMB]

		ex for thumb code:  insmod tz_exploit.ko /sdcard/shellcode.bin 1  
		ex for arm code: 	insmod tz_exploit.ko /sdcard/shellcode.bin 0 

The provided shell code template has two helper functions you can use to call other truztzone functions by address, either from arm -> to thumb or from thumb -> to arm.  Also known as a trampoline and is required when switching between modes.
